This code updates the Anything Popup WordPress plugin to fix problems with responsiveness and portability
* Responsiveness is addressed by checking the screen width and adjusting popup width so that it fits on the screen
* Portability is addressed by changing database table names to lowercase names. This solves the problem caused by table name case sensitivity in some operating systems.   
see reference here:  [MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual >9.2.2 Identifier Case Sensitivity](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html )
